# Spade

Dig up those new Vaporwave tracks straight from Bandcamp.

## Installation

To use `spade`, you'll need NodeJS and NPM.

To use `spade` as a module, run `npm install privatesuite/spade`. To use `spade` as a CLI, run `npm install privatesuite/spade -g`.

## Usage

`spade <number_of_tracks>`.

You can add `--colorless` to your spade command in order to strip all color from its output. Stripping color from the command's output allows you to write the output to a file.

You can add `--location="<location>"` to your command to specify the location of the artists you want to search.
